Git assignment

stage 1 waqs pretty straightforward 
Stage 2 was mostly straightforward although i had big issues linking the about.md file to the README.md file. Kept getting the error "cannot link because file already exists"
Stage 3 and 4 i enjoyed the most as they really show how git can make work organized,  and also enables multiple devs follow up with a project at different points, make suggestions/additions, communicate with each other thereby improving the quality of the project.

i really like Git
